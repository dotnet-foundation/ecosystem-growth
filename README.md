# Growing the .NET ecosystem

This repository is the collaboration space for a working group to figure out how
we can grow the .NET ecosystem.

## Governance

The working group meets once a week for two hours to discuss, review, and
propose next steps. The meeting notes are available [here](meetings).

This working group seeks to have a diverse set of representatives from various
stakeholders. At the same time, we try to keep the working group somewhat small
so that we can have productive meetings. But in order to satisfy the desire for
open participation from everyone – and in the sake of transparency – we made
this repo public, which includes notes and proposals that documents the progress
of the working group. If you have any questions, please open a discussion.
