## Agenda

* We brainstormed on an outline of areas/problems we'd like to tackle, listed
  below.

## Problem outline

* Documentation seems to be worse than in other ecosystems
    - Look at
        - <https://docs.rs/>
        - <https://pkg.go.dev/>
    - Centralized repo for hosting documentation
    - Have interactive documentation
    - "An obvious tool" for generating reference documentation
    - We feel that the NuGet hosted docs + XML docs would address the 90% scenario
    - NGet README

* Maintainer burnout & funding
    - We believe employment is key but are there other options? If so, what
      would they look like?
    - Project "Spotlight" might help to generate attention for projects
    - Can we help grow things like up-for-grabs.net so that contributors could
      find projects "Tinder for GitHub"?

* Avoid OSS cannibalism between Microsoft and other parties
    - "Rules of Engagement"
    - Exit strategy of being bought by a company, such as Microsoft

* 3rd party experiences can be as good as 1st party experiences
    - This also includes curation, for example "these are the web
      frameworks/unit testing framework the .NET Foundation recommends"
    - It seems the .NET Foundation should have an opinion here, maybe similar to
      <https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar>

* Allowing project consumers to make trust decisions
    - Promoting .NET Foundation projects as more trustworthy would require
      rethinking the membership process because we don't consider this today
    - The maturity ladder was considered problematic because it had a notion of
      "Microsoft is making trust decisions/recommendations for everyone else"
    - The NuGet teams is thinking about this space and has reached out to the
      project committee. We should check in on that.
    - There are also other criteria, such as is the project community healthy,
      does the project have a history of not communicating impactful breaking
      changes, is the library usable etc. Those arw very much in the eye of the
      the beholder. This would be an area where Microsoft shouldn't play any
      active role, but the .NET Foundation could. This goes back to project
      governance where the .NET Foundation today differs greatly from, say, the
      Apache Foundation.
    - The bigger question is: what does it mean to be a .NET Foundation project?
    - The bus factor; this is a bit different from funding/burnout in that it
      raises the question which party, if any, is on the hook to figure out what
      to do if a maintainer decides to stop maintaining a project. Compare this
      to, say, a Microsoft employee who leaves the team. Their area of passion
      might not get innovated in anymore, but if there are security issues or
      bugs there is an implicit assumption that Microsoft will find someone to
      get it addressed. That concept doesn't exist for .NET Foundation projects.

* Package consumers can patch their dependencies
    - It is very hard today because .NET build environments are extremely disjoint.
    - There is no easy way to make it reproducible due to package ids making it
      harder to share the patched version with the world/your team.
    - Considering how hard this is it's surprising that we hear very little
      concerns. This might indicate that people have just giving up on this
      space.

* Library guidance
    - What platforms/architecture should a library to run on? For example, very
      few things support ARM64 today.

## Next Steps

* Next meeting is 2021-02-18
* Drill into outline and define deliverable for each item
