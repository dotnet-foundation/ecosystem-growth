## The Microsoft document

* The [Microsoft
  document](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/docs/ecosystem-issues.md)
  doesn't make it clear whether we're trying to grow the set of trusted
  libraries (regardless of OSS) or whether it's OSS
* Our thinking in this working group is primarily focused around OSS because
  that's the 99% of packages on NuGet and is what drives the .NET ecosystem
* Jeremy: Guidance, examples: how do you use the set of libraries (e.g.
  NHibernate vs EF vs Dapper)
* Shaun: More choices also make things harder
* Eriawan: specific quality issues on nuget
    - Write metadata include (e.g. properly declaring references, no dangling
      references, .NET SDK versions)
    - P/Invokes that tie an API to Windows
    - Compat rules
* Folks would like to see a revival of the maturity ladder, BUT:
    - Not as finished gospel
    - With more perspective & empathy for library developer
* Claire
    - .NET Foundation can host documentation, akin to docs.microsoft.com
    - This could, and should, provide an interactive running experience
